# Description

This is a weather application built with React Js that allows users to get accurate and up-to-date weather information for any city in the world. Users can search for weather information by entering the city name in the search bar and will be presented with a list of city names with state and country names to choose from in a dropdown below the search bar. Once the user selects a city, the app will display the current weather information of that particular city, including temperature, wind speed, visibility, humidity, precipitation, cloud cover, cloud ceiling, etc. This is a single-page application that uses a third party API to fetch the weather data and display it on the UI.
